## Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

2. Run the following commands to set up the development environment.

```
bundle install
yarn
```

## Making sure your changes pass all tests

There are a number of automated checks which run on GitHub Actions when a pull request is created.

You can run those checks on your own locally to make sure that your changes would not break the CI build.

### 1. Check the code for JavaScript style violations

```
yarn lint
```

### 2. Check the code for Ruby style violations

```
bundle exec rubocop
```

### 3. Run the JavaScript test suite

```
yarn test
```

### 4. Run all the Ruby test suite

```
bundle exec rake test
```

#### 4.1 Run a single ruby test file

```
bundle exec rspec spec/configuration_spec.rb
```

#### 4.2 Run a single ruby test

```
bundle exec rspec -e "#source_entry_path returns correct path"
```

#### 4.3 Run only Shakapacker gem specs

```
bundle exec rake run_spec:gem
```

#### 4.4 Run only Shakapacker gem specs for backward compatibility
These specs are to check Shakapcker v7 backward compatibility with v6.x

```
bundle exec rake run_spec:gem_bc
```

#### 4.5 Run dummy app test
For this, you need `yalc` to be installed on your local machine

```
bundle exec rake run_spec:dummy
```

## Testing the generator
If you change the generator, check that install instructions work.

1. Update the Gemfile so that gem "shakapacker" has a line like this, pointing to your install of Shakapacker
   ```ruby
   gem 'shakapacker', path: "~/shakacode/forks/shakapacker"
   ```
2. `bundle`
3. Run the generator to confirm that you got the right changes. 

## Find existing issues
You may look at the issues list to find existing known issues to be addressed. In this, we recommend looking at closed issues, particularly with the "[help wanted](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aclosed+)" label.
